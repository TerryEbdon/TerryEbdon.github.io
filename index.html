08-Jul-2020 Monitors, radio &amp; photos</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="h20200808"></a>
Tech photos</h2>
<p>Another session of product photography. I'm slowly working through my "tech
junk" collection, and assigning kit to one of three piles: keep, sell, dump or strip for parts. I'm photographing everything as I go. On today's list were 4-way SVGA monitor splitters and a car mount for my HTC Advantage.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md325"></a>
Monitor splitters</h2>
<p>I have two of these, but never used them. They split an incoming SVGA signal into four identical SVGA outputs. A splitter on my radio desk might be nice. I have two big transceivers, an FT-1000MP HF rig on the left and an FT-736RDX VHF and UHF set up on the right. I've previously had a logging PC positioned to the left of the desk. That's great for HF logging, but awkward for working on VHF and up. I could repurpose an ancient PCs as a radio computer, with a monitor at each end of the desk. A wireless mini-keyboard and mouse, or just the keyboard with built-in track pad, would let me work easily from either position. I guess at least one of the monitor splitters is joining the "keep" pile.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md326"></a>
Remote operation</h2>
<p>Yesterday I used an LED ring light with the light tent, and didn't use a remote shutter release. Today I opened up my "flash case" and pulled out three Yongnuo flash guns with wireless triggers. I also keep a wireless shutter release in the case, so I set that up as well. It didn't work. That was a surprise, as I've used a similar set up many times. The off camera flash worked flawlessly, but the remote trigger did nothing.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md327"></a>
Cable fail</h3>
<p>I could see the wireless receiver getting the command but the camera ignored it. I pulled out a couple of infra-red remotes, they worked fine. After a dig through various bags I found a couple of wired releases and a cable to let a Yongnuo flash-trigger act as a shutter release. Still no joy. Could this be the first time I've used the EOS 5D Mark 3 with a remote release? Possibly. I've worked that way a lot in the past, but I can only remember using the 5D Mark II. Now I was worried that the 5D3's remote socket was defective. I dug out my 5D2 and tried that; it worked perfectly with every remote release. This wasn't looking good. I have a fancy <em>iShoot</em> release, with a built-in timer. This seemed to click into place, the others are a friction fit. I tried the 5D3 again, making sure that each cable was pushed firmly in. That's better, now I had two cables that worked: the <em>iShoot</em> and a simple third party remote. Only the <em>iShoot</em> works reliably on the 5D3. My assumption is that the genuine Canon cable is designed to click into place, and only the <em>iShoot</em> does that. That the others work with the 5D2 is more by luck than design.</p>
